# YALLAH

YALLAH stands for **Yet Another Low-Level Agent Handler**


## Description

The goal of YALLAH is to allow 3D content creators to **generate, customize, animate and dress a virtual human, and deploy it in a Game Engine in few hours of work**.

* For 3D authors, YALLAH is a reference for the development of virtual humans that have to be employed in real-time engines.
* For software developers, YALLAH is an open platform that can be taken as reference to implement new functionalities for improved interactive virtual humans.

We aim at providing a common authoring pipeline, framework, and API for the creation of multi-functional virtual humans that can be used in different application domains: video games, embodied conversational agents, virtual assistants, front-end for chat-bot systems.
